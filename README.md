### Hi, I'm Tyler 👋

##### I work on the [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell) team at Microsoft.

👀 All my work is open source 👀

Sometimes people give me a mic and I talk about 💻. You can also find me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/TylerLeonhardt) live-coding 👨‍💻 📺 projects of all kinds.

I also like ☕️ with the word "mouthfeel" on the packaging.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the [PowerShell extension](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell) for [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the Jupyter Notebooks ecosystem over in [.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive) 📓
- 🤔 I’m looking for help maintaining the [PowerShell Pester Test Explorer](https://github.com/TylerLeonhardt/vscode-powershell-test-explorer) 🐢✅
